# Skin_Cancer_Detection_Using_Sl Models + ANN

The dataset is taken from the kaggle. It consists of 1800 pictures of benign moles and 1497 pictures of malignant classified moles. The pictures have all been resized to low resolution (224x224x3) RGB. The task of this project is to create a model, which can classify a mole visually into benign and malignant.

As the dataset is pretty balanced, the model will be tested on the accuracy score, thus (TP + TN)/(ALL).

It has 2 different classes of skin cancer which are listed below :
1. Benign
2. Malignant

In this project we will try to detect 2 different classes of moles using Convolution Neural Network with keras tensorflow in backend and then analyse the result to see how the model can be useful in practical scenario.
This was a Skin Cancer Detection project using deep learning models where we detected 2 different classes of moles using CNN with Keras TensorFlow in the backend and ResNet-50.

In this project we have followed following 14 steps for model building and evaluation which are as follows :
Step 1 : Importing Essential Libraries
Step 2: Loading pictures and making Dictionary of images and labels
Step 3: Categorical Labels
Step 4: Normalization
Step 5: Train and Test Split
Step 6: Model Building **
**Step 7: Cross-validating model
Step 8: Testing model
Step 9: ResNet50
